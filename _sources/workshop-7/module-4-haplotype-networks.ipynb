    "In module 2 of workshop 7, we learnt about __selective sweeps__ being shared between populations through __adaptive gene flow__, and in and module 3 we used hierarchical haplotype clustering to investigate and visualise haplotypes spreading between countries and species, allowing us to track gene flow at insecticide resistance loci. We also have another methodology in our armamentarium which lets us visualise the relationship between haplotypes in a different way, and that is __haplotype networks__. In this module we will learn how to create and interpret haplotype networks to analyse gene flow at loci associated with insecticide resistance.\n",

If we click or tap a node, information about its composition is provided at the bottom of the figure. This information relates the the `color` parameter, _i.e._ if `color=taxon`, the information will be about species composition.

All of those singleton haplotypes, more that 2 SNPs distance from any other haplotypes, are filtered out in the network analysis as we are only interested in high frequency haplotypes, and networks of closely related haplotypes, because they are likely to be haplotypes under recent positive selection. What remains are the haplotypes which make us the networks we can see above, a much simplified picture of the genetic relationships.\n",

Several larger nodes, closely related to each other gives us evidence that the selection is recent (as we might expect if driven by malaria control insecticidal pressures)."
