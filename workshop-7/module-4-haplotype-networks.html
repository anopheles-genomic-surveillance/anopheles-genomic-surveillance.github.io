<h1>Module 4 - Investigating gene flow at loci of interest using haplotype networks<a class="headerlink" href="#module-4-investigating-gene-flow-at-loci-of-interest-using-haplotype-networks" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p><strong>Theme: Analysis</strong></p>
<p>In module 2 of workshop 7, we learnt about <strong>selective sweeps</strong> being shared between populations through <strong>adaptive gene flow</strong>, and in and module 3 we used hierarchical haplotype clustering to investigate and visualise haplotypes spreading between countries and species, allowing us to track gene flow at insecticide resistance loci. We also have another methodology in our armamentarium which lets us visualise the relationship between haplotypes in a different way, and that is <strong>haplotype networks</strong>. In this module we will learn how to create and interpret haplotype networks to analyse gene flow at loci associated with insecticide resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Please note: This module contains interactive plots using Plotly Dash and Cytoscape.js. These plots will not be visible on the course website, but can be generated by running the notebook for yourself. To run this notebook, click the rocket icon at the top of the page then select “Colab”.</strong></p>

<h2>Haplotype networks<a class="headerlink" href="#haplotype-networks" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We have an experimental function for building haplotype networks in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malariagen_data</span></code> python package (we’re still ironing out some bugs!). Let’s have a look at the doc string for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ag3.plot_haplotype_network()</span></code> function by using “?”.</p>

<p>The required parameters, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">region</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">analysis</span></code> are familiar to us by now, but there are a some new optional parameters here that might be useful to understand.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_dist=</span></code> This is the maximum distance in <em>n</em> SNPs where the algorithm will join haplotype nodes together as one network, after which it will split the nodes in to separate networks. The default here is 2 SNPs. We will see an example of how this works shortly.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">color=</span></code> Identifies a column in the sample metadata which determines the colour of pie chart segments within nodes. <em>e.g.</em> we could use “country” or “taxon” columns.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also worth knowing that if you get <strong>403 errors</strong> instead of figures, try reloading your browser tab or restart your browser.</p>
<p>Let’s build a haplotype network around <em>Kdr</em> locus in the <em>Vgsc</em> gene for all the <em>An. coluzzii</em> samples in Ag3.0, and look at the output.</p>

<h3>Technical interpretation<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-interpretation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The output figure represents identical haplotypes as <strong>nodes</strong> (circles), the larger the node, the greater the number of identical haplotypes. In this example, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">color</span></code> parameter has been set to the “country” column of the haplotype metadata, so the node colour proportions represent the countries where that haplotype was present in our data set. We often also set the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">color</span></code> parameter to “taxon”, in which case, node colour proportion represents the species which carried that haplotype. If we click or tap a node, information about its composition is provided at the bottom of the figure. This information relates the the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">color</span></code> parameter, <em>i.e.</em> if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">color=taxon</span></code>, the information will be about species composition. Nodes can also be moved to aid visualisation (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shift</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">click</span></code> to select multiple), and the whole figure can be zoomed in and out using the mouse wheel.</p>
<p>The <strong>edges</strong> (lines) that join nodes together represent the genetic distance between the nodes in SNPs. Each edge is a single SNP difference.</p>
<p>In the <em>Vgsc</em> example, with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_dist</span></code> (maximum distance) parameter set to two, we se each node in these networks is separated by a maximum genetic distance of 2 SNPs, shown as two edges with a small grey node in the middle. If we click on a small grey node we see “No. haplotypes: 0”. The evolutionary relationship between these haplotype nodes either side of the small node has been inferred as we don’t actually have the intermediate haplotype (with only one SNP difference) in our data set. Let’s increase the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_dist</span></code> parameter and see what happens.</p>

<p>If we increase the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_dist</span></code> parameter to four SNPs, we see haplotypes linked together by up to three “intermediate” node, the network has found connections between more distantly related haplotypes. We generally use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_dist=2</span></code>, mainly because we’re interested here only in groups of very closely related haplotypes, which are therefore very likely to share a recent common origin.</p>
<p>To aid interpretation, <strong>only networks containing more than one haplotype are represented in the output figure</strong>. This means that if a particular haplotype is found only once in our data set (<em>i.e.</em> a singleton haplotype), and that haplotype is more than the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_dist</span></code> number of SNPs different from any other haplotype, it not be shown.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When a fitness increasing mutation occurs, haplotype it resides on comes under selection and it increases in frequency. So, here we’re interested especially in the large nodes, because these are very likely to be <strong>high frequency haplotypes experiencing positive selection</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>During a selective sweep, some additional mutations will occur on the original haplotype. These could be neutral or they could be secondary functional mutations (<em>i.e.</em> further increasing fitness), but key point is that these additional mutations occur, and give us a network of closely related haplotypes. We can infer that each network of connected haplotypes have a recent common origin.</p></li>
<li><p>If a network of connected haplotypes contains haplotypes from two or more countries, this is evidence for adaptive gene flow. Particularly a large node containing haplotypes from multiple countries, this is very strong evidence for adaptive gene flow because exactly the same haplotype is found across countries.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, if a network of connected haplotypes contains haplotypes from two or more species, this is also evidence for a type of adaptive gene flow called <strong>adaptive introgression</strong>. Again, a large node containing haplotypes from multiple species, is very strong evidence for adaptive gene flow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The most striking feature of this <em>Vgsc</em> network is the very large and complex network at the top the figure. The larger node colours show that there are several high frequency haplotypes, closely related to each other, shared across countries. This is a classic signal of adaptive gene flow and in this case, we know from previous research, the haplotypes all carry the L995F <em>kdr</em> mutations that confers resistance to pyrethroids and DDT. Furthermore, the multiple large nodes suggest that secondary mutations have recently occurred on an already selected haplotype, then these new haplotypes have increased in frequency, likely also under selection.</p>
<p>We can also see some smaller complex networks, which suggest potential selective sweeps, two of which show evidence of adaptive gene flow between countries (sharing of identical haplotypes).</p>
<p>The smallest networks are fairly uninformative, and could be considered noise.</p>
<p>Now we have an idea how to run and interpret haplotype networks, let’s look at some insecticide resistance loci we looked at in module 3.</p>

<p>Towards the right hand side of the dendrogram, we can see a region where there are haplotypes closely related to each other. By zooming in we can find that this distance is &lt;5 SNPs between haplotypes, rather than &gt;50 SNPs distance we see elsewhere in the figure. This pattern is suggestive of a selective sweep, and as it includes multiple countries, is also suggestive of <strong>adaptive gene flow</strong>.</p>
<p>Adaptive gene flow is where a fitness improving mutation increases in frequency and spreads across space, between populations and/or between different species. Here we are detecting the increase and spread of the haplotype which carries this locus under positive selection. Given the importance of this gene to insecticide action and the high evolutionary pressure that these chemicals put on mosquitoes, this signal may well be driven by a resistance phenotype associated locus.</p>
<p>Let’s investigate the same region but using haplotype networks.</p>

<p>Looking back at the hierarchical clustering analysis of <em>Ace1</em>, the vast majority of the dendrogram leaves (haplotypes) have long branches (genetic distances) to their nearest neighbours. All of those singleton haplotypes, more that 2 SNPs distance from any other haplotypes, are filtered out in the network analysis as we are only interested in high frequency haplotypes, and networks of closely related haplotypes, because they are likely to be haplotypes under recent positive selection. What remains are the haplotypes which make us the networks we can see above, a much simplified picture of the genetic relationships.</p>
<p>The largest network corresponds to the selective sweep signal we saw in the clustering analysis. Clicking on the largest node, we see it contains 15 identical haplotypes, 11 from Burkina Faso and four from Ghana. As expected, this corresponds perfectly with what we see if we zoom in to the far right side of the clustering figure and roll over the leaves with our mouse, further evidence this haplotype has spread, under selection between countries. Several larger nodes, closely related to each other gives us evidence that the selection is recent (as we might expect if driven by malaria control insecticidal pressures).</p>
