This will allow us to continue making the data freely available.\n",

    "## Data Access using Google Colab\n",
    "To access data from the Vector Observatory, you will need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Make sure you have a Google Account\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow us to configure data access permissions, you will need to provide us with an email address that is associated with a Google account. This could be a standard Google (i.e., Gmail) account, or alternatively it could be your work email address if your employer uses Google Workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2. Fill out the data access request form\n",
    "\n",
    "Please fill out and submit the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [MalariaGEN cloud data access form](https://forms.gle/kCqistorZyxaU4LP7)\n",
    "\n",
    "All requests for data access will be granted subject to verification checks and agreement to reasonable use. This is to ensure that the data resources remain accessible to everyone. Submitting this form will allow us to configure storage permissions and monitor storage for excessive network usage in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Ensure you are using the latest version of the `malariagen_data` Python package\n",
    "\n",
    "If you access data via the `malariagen_data` Python package, please upgrade to version 9.0 or higher. These versions will automatically use your authentication credentials when accessing data in Google Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4. Ensure you are using the same Google Account you registered with\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start running some code in Google Colab using the `malariagen_data` Python package, you will be asked to authenticate with your Google Account. Make sure that you use the same account you used during Steps 1 and 2 as you will not be able to use the `malariagen_data` Python package otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5. Accept to grant Colaboratory Runtimes additional access to your Google account\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you connect your Google Account to a Colab notebook, you will be asked to grant Colaboratory Runtimes additional access to your Google account. You need to \"Select all\" in order to get access to the data through the API on Colab. You can find a video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dOPimdsPabvOoWkKdomWl8v24LRvjiaj/view) showing you the whole process."
